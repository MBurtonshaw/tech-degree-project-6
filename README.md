Style changes:
-I added a fade-in effect to certain elements as the user scrolls down; first few elements left without effect or the page loads with those elements hidden.
-I added the fade-in effect to those last scrolling elements because when the page loads they aren't in sight; they fade in normally.
-I changed the layout for mobile a little; centered things, got rid of bullet points on lists.
